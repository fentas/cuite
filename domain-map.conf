# Domain Path Mapping
# Format: glob-pattern = domain-name
# Used by hooks to detect which domain a file belongs to.
# One mapping per line. First match wins. Lines starting with # are comments.
#
# Examples:
# src/api/* = backend
# src/ui/* = frontend
# src/components/* = frontend
# lib/* = core
# .github/workflows/* = devops
# *Dockerfile* = devops
# infra/* = kubernetes
#
# Add your project's path-to-domain mappings below:
